Relationship Mining
===================

Various scripts related to reasoning and pattern mining experiments for the AGI-Bio project. 

Description
-----------

bio.py- relationship mining based on direct evaluation and other functionality for the bio atomspace

subgraph.py - for creating smaller connected subgraphs of the larger full bio atomspace (for the 
              purpose of experiments with PLN and pattern mining)

scheme - output files from the above programs of atoms in scheme format that can be loaded into an
         atomspace
         
Generated relationship mining and subgraph data is in a separate repo here: git@gitlab.com:opencog-bio/bio-data.git
