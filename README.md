AGI-Bio
=======

Prototype project utilizing the OpenCog framework for genomic
research. In particular it aims at experimenting with cognitive
synergy between MOSES, PLN and other OpenCog components.

see [mozi.ai](https://github.com/MOZI-AI) repositories for current development of opencog bioinformatics tools as [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/) sevices.

Requirements
------------

- OpenCog https://github.com/opencog/opencog

Description
-----------

**bioscience** - code to be built and installed with opencog to provide `GeneNode` and `MoleculeNode` atoms

**knowledge-import** -- scripts for converting external knowledge bases into
   scheme files for importing into the atomspace

**moses-scripts** -- scripts for importing MOSES models distinguishing binary phenotype categories based on gene expression data into the atomspace.
